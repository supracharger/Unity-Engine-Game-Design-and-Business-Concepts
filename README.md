### Description (Coursera Specialization by Michigan State University):
The Game Design & Development Specialization combined Game design with Unity Engine & business of games. Includes a large amount of projects, and the time span of this class is seven months, but I was able to complete it in four. We created various games from “Roller Madness” to my final project “Helicopter Resurgence, ” and learned to create all the documentation on the business side.
